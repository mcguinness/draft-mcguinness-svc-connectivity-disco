--- abstract

This specification defines a per-user service connectivity catalog: a standardized, authorization-aware answer to the question "which services can this user and client connect to right now, and how?" Existing discovery describes individual services but does not reflect the per-user, per-client authorization decisions that determine what is actually reachable.

A client, such as an autonomous agent, a command-line tool, an SDK, or an application launcher, makes a single authenticated request to the Service Catalog Endpoint, discovered from the user's identity provider metadata after sign-in, and receives the reachable services that match its request. Each service carries descriptive metadata and one or more connection methods. A connection method says how to connect. It describes how a credential is acquired and presented (for example, by OAuth 2.0 token exchange or the authorization code grant, an API key, or mutual TLS), or how a browser single sign-on is launched. OAuth 2.0 is not assumed.

A service may be an HTTP API, a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, or an Agent2Agent (A2A) agent, and a connection may obtain a credential or launch a browser single sign-on. The catalog can therefore serve as a machine-readable, connection-aware superset of an enterprise single sign-on application catalog. A client can plan intent-scoped access before requesting any token.

# Introduction

A client acting on behalf of a user, often an autonomous agent, needs a basic answer before it can do useful work: *which services can this user and client connect to right now, and how is each connection established?* Today there is no standardized, authorization-aware answer. Service inventories live in static configuration, proprietary catalogs, or human documentation, and connection details are discovered reactively, one service at a time after an authorization failure. Static configuration in particular cannot reflect the per-user and per-client authorization decisions that determine what is actually reachable at a given moment.

Existing discovery mechanisms describe services. They do not say which services a particular user and client may reach, nor how to connect. OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata {{RFC9728}} describes a *single* resource the client already knows about, typically after an HTTP 401 challenge. OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata {{RFC8414}} describes a *single* authorization server. The Model Context Protocol authorization specification {{MCP-AUTHORIZATION}}, MCP Server Cards {{MCP-SERVER-CARD}}, A2A Agent Cards {{A2A}}, and APIs.json {{APISJSON}} describe individual services or agents for human and tooling consumption. None answers, for a given user and client, *what is reachable and how do I connect*. The closest relative is OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange Target Service Discovery {{TOKEN-EXCHANGE-DISCOVERY}}, which performs authorization-aware discovery for one mechanism (token exchange). This document generalizes that idea across connection mechanisms, and a client that only needs token exchange can use the catalog as a superset of it.

This specification defines the per-user **service connectivity catalog** and the discovery protocol that produces it. A client makes a single authenticated request to the **Service Catalog Endpoint**, scoped to the capability or service it needs, and receives the matching reachable services for that user. Each comes with the descriptive metadata to understand it and one or more **connection methods** to connect to it. The document returned is the *catalog*. The server that produces it is the **Catalog Provider**, which MAY aggregate services across multiple resources, authorization servers, authentication schemes, and administrative domains.

This role is not greenfield. An enterprise identity provider already maintains a per-user catalog of the services a user can reach. It is the single sign-on application catalog behind the user's app launcher or dashboard, built from the same authorization decisions used here. Today that catalog is human-facing. It tells an agent neither how to connect nor whether a connection can be made without interaction. This document makes that existing per-user catalog machine-readable and connection-aware. An identity provider is therefore a natural Catalog Provider, and can expose what it already knows rather than build a new inventory. For an OAuth audience, the result is the reachability analogue of Authorization Server Metadata {{RFC8414}}. Where RFC 8414 describes one authorization server per issuer, the catalog describes the services reachable per user and client.

The central abstraction is the separation of three concerns that existing mechanisms tend to collapse:

* **Discovery**: which services are reachable for this user and client.
* **Acquisition**: how a credential is obtained, or how access is otherwise gained (the connection `profile`, and any profile-specific `type`: OAuth 2.0 token exchange, authorization code, client credentials, the Identity Assertion Authorization Grant {{I-D.oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant}}, a pre-provisioned credential, credential injection by a trusted intermediary, browser single sign-on, or none).
* **Presentation**: how the credential is presented when calling the service, expressed as an OpenAPI {{OPENAPI}} security scheme (a bearer token, API key, or mutual TLS).

Discovery is the catalog's own role. Acquisition and presentation are the two layers carried by each connection method ({{connection-object}}). Separating them lets one model describe OAuth, API keys, mutual TLS, pre-provisioned credentials, and future agent credential models without inventing a new object per mechanism. OAuth 2.0 is not assumed.

This yields the document's guiding principle: **the core catalog is small, and everything mechanism-specific is a separately evolvable profile.** The core is the per-user enumeration of services and, for each, its connection methods and per-connection status. How a credential is acquired and presented is defined by a connection profile. This document specifies the core together with an initial set of profiles. Profiles, service types, categories, and link relations are each extension points behind an IANA registry. They evolve independently of the core. A Catalog Provider and client interoperate on the core and on the profiles they share. The mandatory surface an implementer must adopt stays small even as the breadth below grows.

## Minimal Core

The mandatory core is small. A Catalog Provider and client interoperate using only the following, and every other mechanism is composition of a connection profile or a referenced descriptor:

* an authenticated Service Catalog Endpoint that returns a catalog for the authenticated user ({{catalog-request}})
* a catalog with a `services` array ({{catalog-object}})
* per service: an `id`, a human-readable `display_name`, an optional machine-readable `name`, an optional `type` (default `http`), an optional `endpoint`, optional `links`, and a non-empty `connections` array ({{service-object}})
* per connection: a `profile`, a per-connection availability `status`, and the members that profile defines ({{connection-object}})

A connection profile (such as `oauth`) supplies how a credential is acquired and presented. A referenced descriptor (an OpenAPI document, MCP Server Card, or A2A Agent Card) supplies the service's capabilities. The catalog composes these. It does not restate them.

Beyond the core, the catalog supports capability-based discovery, so a client can find a service by well-known `category` rather than by name ({{service-categories}}). It treats `mcp` and `a2a` services as first class by referencing their Server Card or Agent Card, so a client can learn capabilities without connecting ({{service-types}}). And it supports intent-scoped planning before any token is requested ({{intent}}).

## Consumers and Use Cases

The motivating consumer is an autonomous agent. An agent cannot realistically, at runtime, scan a user's OpenAPI documents, infer which SaaS systems the user has, determine which accounts exist, and derive each service's connection mechanism. Service connectivity discovery answers that in one scoped request. It returns which services are relevant and connectable for the user, and which connection methods apply.

The mechanism is not agent-specific. The same per-user connectivity discovery serves command-line tools, SDKs, enterprise application launchers, workflow and orchestration tools, and delegated assistants. An agent is one consuming class, not the reason the protocol exists.

The value proposition is precise. Without a human in the loop, a client can:

* reconnect to services the user has already linked (`status` of `connected`), avoiding a per-service authorization failure and retry on each one,
* plan across the set of reachable services for a user's goal, and
* request only the intent-scoped access a task needs ({{intent}}).

These are the autonomous capabilities. Automated connection to a service the user has no prior relationship with is different. It requires a trust anchor. That anchor is a prior relationship the client can corroborate, a local policy, or user confirmation ({{autonomous-trust}}). The catalog makes discovery and planning fully autonomous. It makes connection autonomous only within an established trust boundary, and makes that boundary explicit.

## What the Catalog Is Not

This specification does not replace OpenAPI, MCP, A2A, Agentic Resource Discovery {{ARD}}, or the OAuth metadata documents ({{RFC8414}}, {{RFC9728}}). It answers one question those mechanisms leave open, before they become useful: for this authenticated user and this client, which services are reachable, and which connection profile applies? It is glue, not a new center of gravity.

The catalog is therefore deliberately narrow. It is **not**:

* authoritative API or capability metadata: that lives in the service's OpenAPI document, MCP Server Card, or A2A Agent Card, which the catalog references rather than duplicates ({{related-work}});
* a token issuance or grant protocol: it describes how to use existing mechanisms and issues no credential itself ({{connecting}});
* proof of current authorization: a listed service, or a connection's `connected` status, does not guarantee a subsequent call will succeed ({{availability}});
* a substitute for OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource Metadata or Authorization Server Metadata: those remain the authoritative source for endpoints and policy, and a client re-anchors to them before acting when using the `oauth` profile ({{profile-oauth}}).

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses the following terms:

Catalog Provider:
: The server that hosts the Service Catalog Endpoint and returns the catalog for the authenticated user. A Catalog Provider MAY describe services served by many resource servers, protected by many authorization servers, and using many authentication schemes. It is a role distinct from, and not necessarily co-located with, any service it describes.

Client:
: An application, such as an autonomous agent, that requests the catalog and subsequently connects to services on behalf of a user.

Service:
: Something a client can call on behalf of the user, such as an HTTP API or an MCP server. A service has a service type (see {{service-types}}).

Connection Method:
: One way a client can gain access to a service. Most connection methods separate two layers: acquisition (how a credential is obtained, given by the `profile` and, where needed, a profile-specific `type`; see {{connection-profiles}}) and presentation (how the credential is presented to the service; see {{connection-object}}). A launch-style method instead opens a single sign-on start URL in a user agent, where the identity provider federates a session and the client holds no credential ({{profile-sso}}). OAuth 2.0 token issuance is one acquisition profile. Others use a pre-provisioned credential, delegate credential handling to a trusted intermediary, perform browser single sign-on, or use none.

All members and string values defined by this document are case sensitive unless otherwise stated. All URIs are absolute URIs {{RFC3986}} unless otherwise stated.

In this document, the *catalog* (the returned document) and the *Service Catalog Endpoint* are the concrete artifacts. *Service connectivity discovery* is the protocol this document defines. A client that encounters an unknown service type MAY retain and display the service object, but cannot assume service-type-specific behavior for it. A client that encounters an unknown connection profile MUST NOT attempt to execute that connection method unless it implements the specification that defines the profile.

# Overview {#processing-model}

This section summarizes how a client uses the catalog end to end. The sections that follow specify each step.

1. Discover the catalog endpoint ({{endpoint-discovery}}).
2. Authenticate to the catalog and retrieve it ({{catalog-request}}).
3. Filter and select a service ({{filtering}}, {{service-object}}).
4. Select a connection method ({{connection-object}}).
5. Establish trust in the selected connection as its profile requires (for the `oauth` profile, this means re-anchoring trust to the resource's metadata) ({{connection-profiles}}).
6. Connect ({{connecting}}). For a credential-based connection, obtain the credential and call the service presenting it. For a launch-style connection (`sso` or `portal`), open the connection's `launch_uri` in a user agent.

# The Service Catalog Endpoint

The Service Catalog Endpoint is an HTTP resource that returns the catalog of services available to the authenticated user. The client MUST use TLS as specified in {{Section 1.6 of RFC6749}}.

## Discovering the Catalog Endpoint {#endpoint-discovery}

The Service Catalog Endpoint is anchored to the user's identity provider: the OAuth 2.0 authorization server (or OpenID Connect Provider) that the user signs in to. After the user has authenticated, a client discovers and calls the endpoint as follows:

1. Determine the issuer. When the client has completed an OpenID Connect sign-in, the issuer is the `iss` value of the ID token. When the client starts from only a user identifier (for example, an `acct:` URI) and has not yet signed in, it MAY use WebFinger {{RFC7033}} to resolve the issuer, using the relation type `http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer`, and then sign in. WebFinger is used only to resolve the issuer. It MUST NOT be used to convey the catalog endpoint or its contents (see {{privacy-considerations}}).

2. Read the discovery metadata. The client fetches the issuer's authorization server metadata {{RFC8414}} (an OpenID Connect deployment uses the OpenID Provider configuration, which reuses the same metadata registry) and reads the `service_catalog_endpoint` value ({{iana-as-metadata}}), having verified that the metadata `issuer` matches the expected issuer. The metadata value is a JSON string containing an absolute HTTPS URL with no fragment component.

    * The metadata value is the primary, RECOMMENDED mechanism. The client SHOULD prefer it when present.
    * If the metadata omits `service_catalog_endpoint`, a provider co-located with the issuer MAY publish a catalog metadata document at the well-known URI `/.well-known/service-catalog` using the issuer's scheme, host, and port {{RFC8615}} (see {{catalog-metadata}} and {{iana-well-known}}). That document is host-level metadata, not the per-user catalog, and MAY be cached. Its `service_catalog_endpoint` member names the Service Catalog Endpoint, which the client then calls as in step 3. This fallback is an optional deployment convenience, not a requirement. If the issuer identifier contains a path component, clients SHOULD use issuer metadata or explicit configuration rather than infer a path-relative well-known URL.
    * A client MUST NOT treat a catalog, or a catalog metadata document, at an origin different from the issuer as authoritative for the issuer's users on the basis of URL structure alone. Cross-origin authority requires the metadata value or explicit configuration.

3. Retrieve the catalog. The client sends an authenticated request to the endpoint with the user's access token ({{catalog-request}}). The catalog is scoped to the user identified by the access token, not by the endpoint URL.

A client MAY instead be configured directly with the absolute URL of a Service Catalog Endpoint, in which case steps 1 and 2 are not used. The Catalog Provider that hosts the endpoint MAY be co-located with the authorization server or operated separately. When operated separately, the access token presented to the endpoint MUST be one the Catalog Provider accepts (for example, issued with the Catalog Provider as an audience).

### Catalog Metadata {#catalog-metadata}

A catalog metadata document is a JSON {{RFC8259}} object that describes a Catalog Provider at a host, separately from the per-user catalog it serves. It is host-level, contains no per-user data, and MAY be cached and served publicly. A provider publishes it at the well-known URI `/.well-known/service-catalog` ({{iana-well-known}}), served with the media type `application/json`. It has the following member:

service_catalog_endpoint:
: REQUIRED. A JSON string containing the absolute HTTPS URL, with no fragment component, of the per-user Service Catalog Endpoint ({{catalog-request}}). This is the same value an authorization server MAY advertise in its metadata ({{iana-as-metadata}}). When both are present, they MUST be consistent. Because this document and the authorization server metadata are public, this URL MUST NOT encode per-user information. The catalog is scoped by the access token, not by the URL ({{catalog-request}}).

A catalog metadata document MAY include additional members describing the catalog service. Clients MUST ignore members they do not understand. The document is metadata only. The per-user catalog is obtained by an authenticated request to the `service_catalog_endpoint` it names, not from the well-known URI itself.

## Catalog Request {#catalog-request}

The client retrieves the catalog by sending an HTTP `GET` request to the Service Catalog Endpoint. A client SHOULD send an `Accept` header field that includes `application/service-catalog+json`. A request with no `Accept` header field, or one whose `Accept` matches the catalog media type (including via `*/*` or `application/*+json`), is acceptable for content negotiation. Only when the request's `Accept` header field is present and matches none of these MAY the Catalog Provider reject the request with HTTP 406 (Not Acceptable).

The client MUST authenticate the request. The Catalog Provider determines the user on whose behalf the catalog is produced from the request credentials. The following requirements apply:

* As a mandatory-to-implement baseline that any client can rely on, a Catalog Provider MUST accept an OAuth 2.0 access token presented with the `Authorization` request header field and the `Bearer` scheme {{RFC6750}}, where the token's audience identifies the Catalog Provider.
* A Catalog Provider MAY additionally accept other authentication methods.
* A client SHOULD use the bearer baseline unless it has out-of-band knowledge of another supported method.
* If the request is not authenticated and authentication is required, the Catalog Provider MUST return an HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) response.

A client SHOULD scope its request to the capability or service it needs, using the filtering query parameters in {{filtering}}, rather than retrieve the user's entire catalog. A scoped request, for example by `category` or by a search term, is the primary and expected use. A Catalog Provider MAY require a request to be scoped, and MAY restrict unscoped, full-catalog enumeration to clients specifically authorized for it ({{information-disclosure}}). A client MAY page through a large result with the pagination query parameters in {{pagination}}. A Catalog Provider MUST ignore any query parameter it does not support or understand. A provider that does support a parameter applies it as specified, including rejecting an invalid `limit` or `cursor` ({{pagination}}). All query parameter names and values are case sensitive.

The following is an example request for the user's email services:

    GET /service-catalog?category=email HTTP/1.1
    Host: catalog.example.com
    Authorization: Bearer SlAV32hkKG...ACCESSTOKEN...
    Accept: application/service-catalog+json

### Filtering {#filtering}

A client MAY include the following OPTIONAL query parameters to filter the services returned. When several different filter parameters are present, a service is returned only if it matches all of them (logical AND). When a single filter parameter is repeated, a service is returned if it matches any of the repeated values (logical OR), except for `tag` as noted below. Filtering is applied before pagination ({{pagination}}).

category:
: A well-known service category value (see {{service-categories}}), such as `email` or `calendar`. Only services in the given category are returned. MAY be repeated (OR).

type:
: A service type value (see {{service-types}}), such as `http` or `mcp`. Only services of the given type are returned. MAY be repeated (OR).

status:
: A connection status value (see {{connection-object}}): `connected`, `available`, `consent_required`, or `unavailable`. Only services that have at least one connection method with the given status are returned. MAY be repeated (OR). For example, `status=connected&status=available` returns services the client can use without user interaction.

profile:
: A connection profile value (see {{connection-profiles}}), such as `oauth` or `proxy_injected`. Only services that have at least one connection method with the given profile are returned. MAY be repeated (OR). This lets a client limit results to connection profiles it implements.

tag:
: A free-form tag value (see the `tags` member in {{service-object}}). Only services that carry the given tag are returned. MAY be repeated. When repeated, a service is returned only if it carries all of the given tags (AND).

id:
: A service identifier (see the `id` member in {{service-object}}). Only the service with the given identifier is returned. MAY be repeated (OR). This supports refreshing one or more already-known services.

q:
: A free-text search string. The Catalog Provider MAY use this value to match services by `display_name`, `description`, or other provider-defined criteria.

Filtering selects whole service objects. The `connections` array of a returned service is not pruned to the connections that matched. A `status` or `profile` filter is evaluated against each connection's effective status or profile; the effective status is the default `available` when `status` is omitted (see {{connection-object}}).

Filter support requirements:

* A Catalog Provider SHOULD support the `category`, `type`, `profile`, and `id` filters. Support for the other filters is OPTIONAL.
* A Catalog Provider that paginates ({{pagination}}) MUST support the `category`, `type`, `profile`, and `id` filters, so that a client can limit a large result set at the server rather than retrieving and locally filtering every page.
* Because an unsupported optional filter is ignored rather than rejected, a client MUST NOT assume such a filter was applied, and SHOULD apply its own filtering to the result as needed.

### Pagination {#pagination}

A catalog may be large. A Catalog Provider MAY return services across multiple pages, and a client pages through them using the following OPTIONAL query parameters:

limit:
: A positive integer indicating the maximum number of services the client wishes to receive in a single response. The Catalog Provider MAY return fewer and MAY impose its own maximum page size. A `limit` greater than that maximum is treated as the maximum. A Catalog Provider that supports the `limit` parameter MUST reject a `limit` that is zero, negative, or not an integer with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) ({{error-response}}).

cursor:
: An opaque pagination cursor obtained from the `next_cursor` member (see {{catalog-object}}) of a previous response. The client MUST treat the cursor as opaque and MUST NOT modify it. A client that sends a `cursor` SHOULD repeat the same filter parameters it used to obtain that cursor. A Catalog Provider MAY reject a request that combines a `cursor` with inconsistent filters.

When more services match than are returned in a response, the Catalog Provider includes a `next_cursor` member in the catalog object ({{catalog-object}}). Its absence indicates no further services are available. A Catalog Provider MAY also indicate the next page with a Link header field {{RFC8288}} using the relation type `next`. When both are present they MUST identify the same next page, and `next_cursor` is the normative signal (a client MAY ignore the Link header).

The following rules apply across a pagination sequence:

* The Catalog Provider MUST order services consistently across the pages of a single sequence, so that, absent concurrent changes, each matching service appears on exactly one page.
* A cursor MAY expire. A request with an expired or otherwise invalid `cursor` MUST be rejected with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) ({{error-response}}). The client recovers by restarting from the first page.
* A paginated catalog is a best-effort snapshot, not a transaction. A client MUST NOT assume consistency across pages: a service or connection returned on an earlier page MAY have changed, or had its authorization revoked, by the time a later page is fetched.
* A Catalog Provider MAY paginate even when the client did not supply a `limit`.

The following example requests the next page using a cursor from a previous response:

    GET /service-catalog?cursor=b2Zmc2V0OjUw HTTP/1.1
    Host: catalog.example.com
    Authorization: Bearer SlAV32hkKG...ACCESSTOKEN...
    Accept: application/service-catalog+json

## Catalog Response {#catalog-response}

If the request is valid and authenticated, the Catalog Provider returns an HTTP 200 (OK) response whose body is a JSON {{RFC8259}} object, the **catalog object** ({{catalog-object}}). The `Content-Type` of the response MUST be `application/service-catalog+json` ({{iana-media-type}}). The media type suffix `+json` allows generic JSON tooling to process it. A JSON Schema for the catalog object MAY be published with this specification, and the catalog object MAY carry a `$schema` member referencing it, so that clients can validate responses and generate types. A complete example appears in {{response-example}}.

When constructing the catalog, the Catalog Provider:

* MUST evaluate the authenticated user's permissions and the calling client's permissions. The specific authorization policy evaluation is implementation specific.
* MUST include only services and connection methods that the user and client are permitted to use.
* MUST omit any member that would otherwise contain an empty string, an empty array, or a null value. The REQUIRED `services` member is the sole exception: it is always present, and is an empty array when no services are available.

The Catalog Provider MAY include HTTP caching headers as specified in {{RFC9111}}. Because the catalog is user specific, any cache directives MUST mark the response as private (for example, `Cache-Control: private`). To let a client refresh a large per-user catalog cheaply, the Catalog Provider SHOULD support conditional requests by returning an `ETag` (and/or `Last-Modified`) and honoring `If-None-Match` (and/or `If-Modified-Since`) {{RFC9110}}, responding 304 (Not Modified) when the catalog is unchanged.

The catalog is a point-in-time snapshot of a per-user state that changes as access is granted, revoked, or provisioned. A client MUST NOT assume a previously retrieved catalog is still current. It detects change by re-fetching, using conditional requests and the `updated` time, and MAY use a `Cache-Control` `max-age` as a refresh hint. This document defines no push or subscription mechanism. A deployment that needs near-real-time change delivery provides it out of band.

### Authority for Inclusion {#inclusion}

Authorization applies at two distinct levels, and the catalog speaks only to the first:

* Discoverability authorization: whether the Catalog Provider may show this service and connection method to this user and client. Inclusion in the catalog is the provider's assertion that it may. The basis is provider-defined and may combine, for example, authorization server policy, enterprise administrator policy, the user's account state, and the service provider's registration state. This document does not mandate a particular basis.
* Runtime authorization: whether a given call will actually succeed. This decision belongs to the service and its authorization server, is made at call time, and is not delegated to the Catalog Provider.

The following constraints follow:

* A Catalog Provider MUST include only services and connection methods the user and client are permitted to discover and use, to the best of the provider's knowledge. It MUST NOT pad the catalog with services the user is not permitted to discover. It MAY include a discoverable service that the user cannot currently call, but only by marking every connection method for that service as `unavailable` ({{availability}}).
* Discoverability authorization is a point-in-time assertion, not a guarantee of runtime authorization ({{availability}}). The authoritative decision remains with the service and its authorization server.
* A client MUST NOT treat inclusion (discoverability authorization) as runtime authorization. It still applies the selected profile's trust requirements and obtains a credential through the normal flow ({{connection-profiles}}).

### Service Availability and Status {#availability}

"Available to the user" is split across two levels: whether a service *appears* at all, and the per-connection `status` ({{connection-object}}) of how it can be used.

A service appears in the catalog when the user is permitted to know it exists, that is, it is *discoverable*. Appearing does not by itself mean the user can call it now. That is conveyed per connection:

* Discoverable: the service is listed at all. A Catalog Provider MUST omit services the user is not permitted to discover.
* Connectable without interaction: at least one connection has `status` `available` or `connected`.
* Connectable after consent: a connection has `status` `consent_required`.
* Known but currently unavailable: every connection has `status` `unavailable`, for example, the service is licensed but not provisioned for this user, or is temporarily blocked by policy. The service is still shown so the user or agent knows it exists and how it might be enabled (for example, via a `sign-up` link to create an account, or a `request-access` link to request access the user does not yet have).

In short, inclusion answers "may the user know about this service," and `status` answers "can the user connect, and how."

### Error Response {#error-response}

If the request fails, the Catalog Provider returns an HTTP error response. The response body, when present, is a problem details object {{RFC9457}} with the media type `application/problem+json`. The HTTP status code is set as follows:

* 401 (Unauthorized): authentication is required and was missing or invalid. The Catalog Provider MUST include a `WWW-Authenticate` header field {{RFC6750}} indicating how to authenticate.
* 403 (Forbidden): the authenticated client is not authorized to use the catalog endpoint.
* 400 (Bad Request): the request is malformed, or includes an invalid or expired `cursor` (see {{pagination}}).
* 406 (Not Acceptable): the request's `Accept` header field excludes the catalog media type.
* 429 (Too Many Requests): the client has exceeded a rate limit (see {{information-disclosure}}). The Catalog Provider SHOULD include a `Retry-After` header field.
* 503 (Service Unavailable): the Catalog Provider is temporarily unable to handle the request.

The HTTP status code is the authoritative machine-readable error signal, and a client MUST NOT depend on the problem-details `type` being present. More than one condition maps to 400: a malformed request, and an invalid or expired `cursor`. A Catalog Provider that wants these to be distinguishable SHOULD use a distinct, stable problem-details `type` URI for each. A client can then branch on `type` when it is present (for example, to recover from an invalid `cursor` by restarting pagination), while still relying on the status code otherwise.

The following is an example error response:

    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    Content-Type: application/problem+json
    WWW-Authenticate: Bearer

    {
      "type": "https://example.com/probs/invalid-token",
      "title": "The access token is missing or expired",
      "status": 401
    }

# Catalog Data Model

This section defines the JSON objects returned by the endpoint: the catalog object and the service, link, and connection objects it contains, together with the service-type, category, connection-profile, and profile-specific connection-type vocabularies. Worked examples follow in {{response-example}}.

## Catalog Object {#catalog-object}

The catalog object contains the following members:

$schema:
: OPTIONAL. A URI referencing the JSON Schema that describes this catalog object, for validation and type generation. The catalog format evolves additively: new members are added under the unknown-member rule below and new values through the IANA registries, so no separate version member is defined. A future incompatible revision would be signaled by a new media type.

services:
: REQUIRED. An array of **service objects** (see {{service-object}}), each describing a service available to the user. If the user has access to no services, this member is an empty array.

display_name:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving a human-readable name for the catalog.

description:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving a human-readable description of the catalog.

updated:
: OPTIONAL. The timestamp at which the catalog content was last updated, as an {{RFC3339}} date-time string.

next_cursor:
: OPTIONAL. An opaque string. If present, more services are available than were returned. The client obtains the next page by repeating the request with the `cursor` query parameter set to this value (see {{pagination}}). If absent, no further services are available.

warnings:
: OPTIONAL. An array of warning objects reporting that the catalog may be incomplete or degraded, for example because the Catalog Provider could not enumerate one of the sources it aggregates. Each warning object has a REQUIRED `code` (a short machine-readable string), an OPTIONAL `message` (a human-readable explanation), and an OPTIONAL `source` (an identifier of the affected source or administrative domain). When a warning indicates incomplete enumeration, a client MUST NOT treat the absence of a service from the catalog as evidence that the user cannot reach it.

Extensions MAY define additional members of the catalog object. Clients MUST ignore members they do not understand.

## Service Object {#service-object}

A service object describes a single service and how to connect to it. It contains the following members:

id:
: REQUIRED. A string giving a stable, provider-assigned identifier for the service, unique within the catalog. Clients MAY use this value to correlate a service across catalog requests to the same Catalog Provider.

uid:
: OPTIONAL. An absolute URI (which MAY be a URN) that globally and stably identifies this service object, independent of any one catalog. Whereas `id` is unique only within this catalog, `uid` lets a client correlate this service across different Catalog Providers, and with the same service as discovered elsewhere (for example, in a public cross-organization discovery catalog such as {{ARD}}, or as an entry in a public AI Catalog {{AI-CATALOG}}). The following apply:

    * Service objects that are instances or tenants of one logical service (grouped by `group`; see below) each carry their own `uid`, just as each has its own `id`.
    * To be meaningful across catalogs, a `uid` SHOULD be minted under a namespace its issuer controls: an HTTPS URL under the service's own origin, or a URN under a namespace registered to the service provider {{RFC8141}}.
    * A `uid` is descriptive only and carries no authority. A client MUST NOT treat a shared `uid` as evidence that two entries are the same service, and MUST NOT infer trust or sameness from a `uid` outside the apparent issuer's control, without applying the trust checks it applies to any catalog entry ({{connection-object}}).
    * A `uid` is a stable cross-provider correlation handle and carries privacy implications ({{privacy-considerations}}).

    It is distinct from `endpoint` (the network location the client calls) and from a connection's `resource` (the resource indicator {{RFC8707}}).

display_name:
: REQUIRED. A string giving a human-readable name for the service, suitable for display to an end user (for example, in a service picker). It MAY be localized and MAY change over time.

name:
: OPTIONAL. A stable, machine-readable name for the service: a slug an agent, command-line tool, or configuration can refer to, such as `example-mail`. It is distinct from the opaque, provider-assigned `id` (a correlation handle) and from the human-readable `display_name`. Where present, it SHOULD be stable across catalog requests.

logo_uri:
: OPTIONAL. A URI of an image to display for the service, for example in a service picker or application launcher. An `icon` link ({{link-object}}), if also present, points to the same image.

connections:
: REQUIRED. A non-empty array of **connection objects** (see {{connection-object}}), each describing one way the client can connect to the service. The Catalog Provider SHOULD order the array from most to least preferred.

type:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving the service type, a value from the registry in {{service-types}}. If omitted, the type is `http`.

description:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving a human-readable description of the service.

categories:
: OPTIONAL. An array of well-known service category values (see {{service-categories}}) describing what the service does, enabling capability-based discovery.

tags:
: OPTIONAL. An array of free-form tag strings categorizing the service.

preferred:
: OPTIONAL. A boolean. When `true`, the Catalog Provider marks this as a preferred choice among comparable services the user could use for the same purpose (for example, the primary service in a `category` or `group`), to aid selection. It is a hint, not a constraint. When absent, the default is `false`.

deprecated:
: OPTIONAL. A boolean. When `true`, the service is deprecated and may be withdrawn. A client SHOULD prefer a non-deprecated alternative when one is suitable, and SHOULD NOT begin a new relationship with a deprecated service without reason. When absent, the default is `false`.

links:
: OPTIONAL. An array of **link objects** (see {{link-object}}) pointing to related resources such as documentation, sign-up, or the MCP Server Card, using link relation types {{RFC8288}}.

endpoint:
: OPTIONAL. A URI giving the network location at which the service is hosted and that the client calls. For an `http` service it is the base URL of the API. For an `mcp` service it is the MCP server endpoint. For an `a2a` service it is the agent endpoint. It is distinct from a connection's `resource` member ({{connection-object}}), the RFC 8707 resource indicator used when requesting a token, which need not be byte-identical to it. A `service` link ({{link-object}}), if present, points to the same location. A service object SHOULD carry `endpoint` unless a `service` link supplies it.

mcp:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object present only when `type` is `mcp` (see {{type-mcp}}).

a2a:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object present only when `type` is `a2a` (see {{type-a2a}}).

tenant:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving a machine-readable identifier for the tenant of a multi-tenant service, when this service object represents one tenant. It is descriptive (it lets a client correlate the service, and the tokens it will obtain, with a tenant context) and aligns with the tenant identifier used in {{TOKEN-EXCHANGE-DISCOVERY}} and {{I-D.oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant}}.

group:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving a stable identifier shared by all service objects that are instances or tenants of the same logical service, so a client can group them (for example, in a picker). Service objects in the same group are otherwise independent: each has its own `id`, `endpoint`, `connections`, and per-user state.

group_display_name:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving a human-readable name for the `group`, suitable as a heading when a client presents the grouped instances or tenants together. Service objects sharing a `group` SHOULD carry the same `group_display_name`.

The service object intentionally carries no authentication-scheme-specific members. Values such as the authorization server, scopes, and resource indicator are properties of a particular authentication scheme, so they appear on the relevant connection object ({{connection-object}}) rather than on the service. A service that supports more than one authentication scheme has more than one connection object, each carrying the values for its scheme.

A logical service the user can reach as more than one instance or tenant (for example, regional deployments, or `dev` and `staging` tenants of one provider) is represented as multiple service objects that share a `group` value, each independently connectable and, where applicable, carrying its own `tenant`. This mirrors the per-tenant target representation of {{TOKEN-EXCHANGE-DISCOVERY}}: the descriptive tenant identity lives on the service object, while any acquisition-time selector (such as a token-exchange `audience`) lives on the connection.

Extensions and service types MAY define additional members of the service object. Clients MUST ignore members they do not understand.

## Service Types {#service-types}

The `type` member of a service object identifies the kind of service, using a value from the "Service Catalog Service Type" registry ({{iana-service-type}}). This document defines three values.

### http {#type-http}

A conventional HTTP API. The `endpoint` member is the base URL of the API. A machine-readable description (for example, an OpenAPI document) MAY be referenced with a `service-desc` link ({{link-object}}). This is the default type when `type` is omitted.

### mcp {#type-mcp}

A Model Context Protocol server {{MCP-AUTHORIZATION}}. Its `endpoint` is the MCP server's URL. A service of type `mcp` SHOULD reference the server's MCP Server Card {{MCP-SERVER-CARD}}, either with an `mcp-server-card` link ({{link-object}}) or with the `server_card_uri` member below, so that a client can learn the server's capabilities without connecting.

A service of type `mcp` MAY include an `mcp` member, a JSON object with the following members:

transport:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving the MCP transport the endpoint uses (for example, `streamable-http`).

server_card_uri:
: OPTIONAL. A URI giving the location of the server's MCP Server Card {{MCP-SERVER-CARD}}.

Because MCP servers use OAuth 2.0 for authorization {{MCP-AUTHORIZATION}}, an `mcp` service typically offers the `oauth` connection profile (for example, with `type` `authorization_code` or `token_exchange`). Service type and connection profile are independent. As for any OAuth service, the client re-anchors to the server's Protected Resource Metadata before acting ({{profile-oauth}}). The location and format of the MCP Server Card are defined by {{MCP-SERVER-CARD}}. This document does not define them, and a Catalog Provider references the card by URL.

### a2a {#type-a2a}

An Agent2Agent (A2A) agent {{A2A}}. Its `endpoint` is the agent's URL. A service of type `a2a` SHOULD reference the agent's A2A Agent Card, either with an `agent-card` link ({{link-object}}) or with the `agent_card_uri` member below, so that a client can learn the agent's skills and capabilities without connecting.

A service of type `a2a` MAY include an `a2a` member, a JSON object with the following members:

transport:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving the A2A transport the endpoint uses (for example, `JSONRPC`).

agent_card_uri:
: OPTIONAL. A URI giving the location of the agent's A2A Agent Card (typically at `/.well-known/agent-card.json`).

As with `mcp`, service type and connection profile are independent. An `a2a` agent describes how callers authenticate to it in its Agent Card, which the catalog references rather than restates.

## Service Categories {#service-categories}

The `categories` member of a service object, and the `category` query parameter ({{catalog-request}}), use well-known category values from the "Service Catalog Service Category" registry ({{iana-category}}) to describe what a service does. This document seeds the registry with the values `email`, `calendar`, `contacts`, `files`, `chat`, `tasks`, `crm`, and `ticketing`. The registry is extensible under an Expert Review policy ({{iana-category}}) so the shared vocabulary stays coherent while keeping the bar to add a common category low. Private or experimental categories use a collision-resistant namespaced form. An agent can rely on registered values to find a service by capability (for example, "an email service") rather than by name.

## Link Object {#link-object}

A link object points to a resource related to a service. It is modeled on the Web Linking framework {{RFC8288}} and contains the following members:

rel:
: REQUIRED. A link relation type {{RFC8288}}: either a registered relation type or an extension relation type (an absolute URI). Relation types commonly used in a catalog include `service` (the service's primary endpoint or home), `service-desc` (a machine-readable API description such as an OpenAPI document), `service-doc` (human-readable documentation), `terms-of-service`, `privacy-policy`, `help`, `status` (a service status page), `icon`, `describedby` (for example, a Protected Resource Metadata document {{RFC9728}}), `sign-up` (where a user can sign up for the service), `request-access` (where the user can request access to a service they cannot currently use), `mcp-server-card` (the service's MCP Server Card {{MCP-SERVER-CARD}}), and `agent-card` (the service's A2A Agent Card {{A2A}}). The relation types `sign-up`, `request-access`, `mcp-server-card`, and `agent-card` are registered by this document (see {{iana-link-relations}}).

href:
: REQUIRED. A URI giving the target of the link.

type:
: OPTIONAL. A string hinting the media type of the link target.

title:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving a human-readable title for the link.

## Connection Object {#connection-object}

A connection object describes one connection method for a service. For a credential-based method it separates two layers: how the client *acquires* a credential and how it *presents* that credential when calling the service. A launch-style method instead carries a `launch_uri` the user agent opens ({{profile-sso}}). A connection object MUST carry enough information for the client either to execute the connection directly or to deterministically fetch the remaining information it needs. Heavy or detailed metadata (for example, the full authorization server metadata document) is referenced by URL rather than inlined.

This document defines the core catalog protocol and several initial connection profiles in one specification. The core catalog is independent of any credential acquisition mechanism. A connection profile defines the profile-specific members, processing rules, and security considerations for one family of connection methods. Future specifications may define additional profiles or update the profiles defined here.

Every connection object has a `profile`:

profile:
: REQUIRED. A string giving the connection profile, drawn from the "Service Catalog Connection Profile" registry ({{connection-profile-registry}}). This document defines `oauth`, `pre_authorized`, `proxy_injected`, `sso`, `portal`, and `none`. A client that encounters an unknown profile MUST NOT execute that connection method unless it implements the specification that defines the profile.

type:
: OPTIONAL. A profile-specific string identifying the specific method within the selected profile, for example the credential acquisition method for `oauth` or the single sign-on protocol for `sso`. The `oauth` profile requires this member and defines its values in the "OAuth Service Catalog Connection Type" registry ({{oauth-connection-type-registry}}). Profiles that define only one method can omit `type`.

present:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object describing how the client presents its credential (the service-authentication layer, distinct from credential acquisition). Its value is a Security Scheme Object as defined in OpenAPI 3.1 or later {{OPENAPI}}, the same model used by OpenAPI `securitySchemes` and A2A Agent Cards {{A2A}}. Because it is a verbatim OpenAPI object, its member names follow OpenAPI conventions (for example, `mutualTLS`, `apiKey`) rather than the snake_case used elsewhere in this document. A client or SDK MUST NOT alter their casing, and in particular MUST NOT snake_case-normalize them. The following apply:

    * Allowed types: the value MUST be of OpenAPI type `http`, `apiKey`, or `mutualTLS`, for example `{"type": "http", "scheme": "bearer"}`, `{"type": "apiKey", "in": "header", "name": "X-API-Key"}`, or `{"type": "mutualTLS"}`. The `oauth2` and `openIdConnect` types MUST NOT appear, because credential acquisition (including OAuth flows) is expressed by the connection profile and, where applicable, `type`.
    * API key location: because `present` is a verbatim OpenAPI object, any `apiKey` location OpenAPI permits is syntactically valid here, but a query-located key places the credential in the request URI, where it is exposed in logs and history. `in: header` is RECOMMENDED. A Catalog Provider SHOULD NOT advertise an `apiKey` with `in: query` for this profile, and SHOULD avoid `in: cookie`; it MAY advertise `in: query` only when a local policy or out-of-band agreement establishes it is safe for the specific service. A client SHOULD reject an `apiKey` scheme with `in: query` by default, presenting it that way only when its own policy permits.
    * When omitted: presentation is resolved by the selected profile. If the profile does not define a default, the client uses the service's referenced descriptor, such as an OpenAPI document, A2A Agent Card, or MCP Server Card.
    * No restatement: the catalog SHOULD NOT inline a `present` value that merely repeats security schemes already published in the service's descriptor (an OpenAPI document via `service-desc`, an A2A Agent Card, or an MCP Server Card). A client obtains those by reference ({{intent}}).
    * Applicability: `present` is primarily for `http` services that lack a referenced descriptor. For `mcp` services, presentation follows the MCP specification (a bearer token over the MCP transport) unless the selected connection profile says otherwise. For `a2a` services, presentation follows the agent's Agent Card. For a `proxy_injected` connection ({{profile-proxy-injected}}), `present` describes how the client authenticates to the intermediary, not to the service. For an `sso` or `portal` connection ({{profile-sso}}, {{profile-portal}}), `present` does not apply, because access is established by browser launch rather than by a credential the client presents.

security_scheme:
: OPTIONAL. A string naming a security scheme defined in the service's referenced descriptor (a key of an OpenAPI `securitySchemes` object, or the `securitySchemes` of an A2A Agent Card) that this connection corresponds to. This lets a client map the connection to a specific scheme rather than inferring it, and is meaningful only for the common case of a single applicable scheme. When the descriptor's security requirements are more complex (multiple required schemes, or alternatives), the client consults the descriptor's security requirements directly. This member does not apply to `mcp` services, whose authorization is defined by the MCP specification rather than by named security schemes.

status:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving the per-user availability of this connection method. It is a planning signal for whether and how a credential can be obtained. It is not a security or trust assertion ({{autonomous-trust}}). If omitted, the client SHOULD treat the status as `available`. Because this default is the most actionable value, "not computed" and "verified available" are indistinguishable. A Catalog Provider SHOULD therefore set `status` explicitly, and a security-conscious client MAY treat a connection whose status it cannot confirm as requiring verification before relying on it. One of:

    * `connected`: The Catalog Provider believes an account or linkage exists for this user (for example, a prior authorization, an account link, or a stored token). This is the provider's assertion that a relationship exists. It does not mean a valid credential is in hand, that the service is the one the user intended, or that calling is safe. The client may still need to obtain or refresh a token, the relationship MAY be stale (expired or revoked), and the assertion is only as trustworthy as the provider, so `connected` alone does not waive the resource confirmation and trust checks of {{profile-oauth}}. A client MUST still handle an authentication failure at call time.
    * `available`: The client can connect using this method without further user interaction (for example, a token exchange or client credentials grant).
    * `consent_required`: Connecting requires user interaction (for example, an authorization code grant with user consent, or an interactive single sign-on).
    * `unavailable`: The method is described for completeness but cannot currently be used by this user.

    These four values are the protocol-relevant distinctions: whether a usable connection already exists, can be established without interaction, requires interaction, or is unusable. Finer operational states (for example, pending administrator approval, an expired credential, or a user-disconnected account) are deployment details, are not standardized, and are conveyed, if at all, through other members or out of band.

account:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object identifying the account this connection is associated with, when the user holds (or can establish) more than one account at the service. An account is a distinct identity or subscription the user holds at the service, established through prior authorization or account linking. How accounts are established or linked is out of scope. The object has the following members:

    * `id`: REQUIRED. An opaque, stable, provider-assigned identifier for the account.
    * `label`: OPTIONAL. A human-readable name for display, such as "Work". It MAY be personal data (see {{privacy-considerations}}).
    * `login_hint`: OPTIONAL. A value the client passes as the OpenID Connect `login_hint` parameter to steer an interactive authorization to this account.

    Two connection objects of the same `profile` and `type` that differ only by `account` represent two distinct accounts, for example, two `connected` mailboxes. A connection with no `account` represents establishing a new account, or an account the provider does not distinguish.

Profiles define additional profile-specific members, as described in {{connection-profiles}}. Extensions MAY define additional members of the connection object. Clients MUST ignore members they do not understand.

## Connection Profiles {#connection-profiles}

This section defines the initial connection profiles. Each profile reuses the common connection object members from {{connection-object}} and defines any profile-specific members, processing rules, and security requirements.

### OAuth Connection Profile {#profile-oauth}

The `oauth` profile describes connection methods that obtain an access token from an OAuth 2.0 authorization server. An `oauth` connection object MUST include a `type` member whose value is drawn from the "OAuth Service Catalog Connection Type" registry ({{oauth-connection-type-registry}}). This document defines `token_exchange`, `authorization_code`, `client_credentials`, and `id_jag`.

The following members are defined by the `oauth` profile. They are carried on the connection object, rather than inherited from the service object or other catalog entries, so each connection is interpreted on its own.

authorization_server:
: REQUIRED. A URI giving the issuer identifier {{RFC8414}} of the authorization server to use for this connection. The client obtains the authorization server's endpoints and capabilities from its metadata {{RFC8414}}.

token_endpoint:
: OPTIONAL. A URI giving the authorization server's token endpoint, provided as an optimization. Before using it, the client MUST verify it matches the `token_endpoint` in the validated metadata {{RFC8414}} of the connection's `authorization_server`. The client MUST NOT send a credential (such as a token exchange `subject_token`) to a `token_endpoint` it has not verified against that metadata. When absent, the client obtains the token endpoint from the authorization server metadata.

resource:
: OPTIONAL. A URI giving the resource indicator {{RFC8707}} the client includes when requesting a token for this connection, as a canonical URI per {{Section 2 of RFC8707}}. This identifies the protected resource and corresponds to the resource described by a Protected Resource Metadata document {{RFC9728}}, which MAY be referenced by a `describedby` link ({{link-object}}). An OAuth connection that can be executed directly SHOULD include `resource`. If `resource` is omitted, the client MUST derive the protected resource identifier from the service's authoritative metadata, descriptor, or challenge response before requesting a token, and MUST NOT treat the catalog's `authorization_server` alone as sufficient authority for the token request.

scopes:
: OPTIONAL. An array of OAuth 2.0 scope values {{Section 3.3 of RFC6749}} available to this connection. This is a coarse, planning-time hint and an upper bound: it lists scopes the user and client may request, not what any particular operation requires. Operation-level scope requirements come from the service's descriptor (for example, an OpenAPI {{OPENAPI}} document) and are enforced by the authorization server. A client SHOULD request the least privilege its task requires rather than the full set.

authorization_details_types:
: OPTIONAL. An array of OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests {{RFC9396}} `authorization_details` type identifiers (strings) that this connection accepts for this user, enabling fine-grained, intent-scoped access requests independently of `scopes`. Like `scopes`, this is a planning-time hint and an upper bound, not a per-operation requirement. It is the per-service, per-user counterpart to the server-wide `authorization_details_types_supported` metadata of {{RFC9396}}: it tells the client which types are usable here, while the schema, documentation, and examples for each type are obtained from the authorization server's Authorization Details Types Metadata {{RAR-METADATA}} (discovered via this connection's `authorization_server`) rather than restated in the catalog.

client_id:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving a static, pre-assigned OAuth 2.0 client identifier the client uses with the `authorization_server`. It is present with `client_registration` `static` (or on its own, which the client treats as `static`), and is absent with `dynamic` and `client_id_metadata_document`, which do not use a pre-assigned identifier.

client_registration:
: OPTIONAL. A string naming how the client establishes its identity with the `authorization_server`. One of:

    * `static`: use the pre-assigned identifier in the `client_id` member, which MUST be present. This supports authorization servers that require a pre-registered, per-service, or per-tenant client.
    * `dynamic`: register using OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration {{RFC7591}}, discovering the registration endpoint from the authorization server metadata. The authorization server issues the client identifier.
    * `client_id_metadata_document`: use an HTTPS URL the client controls as its `client_id`, per {{CIMD}}. The authorization server dereferences that URL to obtain the client's metadata, with no pre-registration and no registration call. Support is advertised by `client_id_metadata_document_supported` in the authorization server metadata {{RFC8414}}. Where an authorization server has instead pre-registered a specific Client ID Metadata Document URL, the catalog uses `static` and carries that URL as the `client_id`.

    When `client_registration` is absent, the client uses the `client_id` if one is present, and otherwise an identity it determines is appropriate by other means (including no client identifier where the flow requires none).

    Additional values MAY be defined by specifications that update the `oauth` profile. A client that encounters a `client_registration` value it does not implement MUST NOT use that connection method, as for an unknown profile ({{connection-object}}).

The OAuth values in a connection object (`authorization_server`, `resource`, `scopes`, and `authorization_details_types`) are an optimization: a cache of values whose authoritative sources are the service's Protected Resource Metadata {{RFC9728}}, the authorization server metadata {{RFC8414}}, and the service's descriptor. They let a client act without extra round trips, but they are not a second source of truth. Specifically:

* Before using an OAuth connection to obtain or present a token, a client MUST re-anchor trust to the resource it intends to call: it MUST confirm that the connection's `authorization_server` is listed in the Protected Resource Metadata {{RFC9728}} of the service's `resource` (for `mcp` services, through the standard MCP flow; see {{type-mcp}}). When the connection omits `resource`, the client first derives the protected resource identifier as described above. If the client cannot determine and validate the protected resource, it MUST NOT use the connection, unless the connection identifies its target solely by an authorization-server-local `audience` (the `token_exchange` and `id_jag` types), for which the alternative anchor in the next bullet applies. This prevents a misconfigured or malicious catalog from directing the client to an attacker-controlled authorization server (see {{security-considerations}}).

* When an OAuth connection has no `resource` and identifies its target solely by an authorization-server-local `audience` (`token_exchange` ({{type-token-exchange}}) or `id_jag` ({{type-id-jag}})), there is no Protected Resource Metadata to anchor against, and resource re-anchoring does not apply. The trust anchor is instead the connection's `authorization_server`, which issues and audience-restricts the resulting token. Because executing such a connection discloses a credential to that authorization server (a `subject_token` for `token_exchange`, an assertion for `id_jag`), the client MUST NOT present it unless it independently trusts that authorization server to receive it: for example, because the authorization server is the issuer of the presented token or the user's identity provider, or is permitted by a trust policy or explicit configuration ({{confused-deputy}}). Trusting the authorization server is necessary but not sufficient: a trusted server may still not be authoritative for the catalog-supplied `audience`, which the catalog alone chose. The client's local policy or configuration MUST therefore bind the specific (`authorization_server`, `audience`) pair to the intended target service before the client presents the credential; absent such a binding, the connection is not usable without user confirmation. Having obtained a token, the client SHOULD also confirm it is bound to the intended service before using it ({{type-token-exchange}}).

* Re-anchoring proves that the `authorization_server` is authoritative for the `resource`. It does not prove that the `resource` (or `endpoint`) is the service the user intended: a compromised or overly broad Catalog Provider could supply a self-consistent `resource`, and could equally assert a relationship (a `status` of `connected`, or an `account`; see {{connection-object}}) for an attacker-controlled service. A catalog-asserted relationship is therefore a hint, not proof.

    Accordingly, for any connection that has, or from which the client can derive, a `resource`, the client MUST independently confirm that resource before obtaining or presenting a credential. Catalog-asserted `connected` alone does not satisfy this; the confirmation MAY instead be met by any of:

    * a prior relationship the client can corroborate from its own state (for example, it already holds, or previously itself obtained, a credential for that exact resource);
    * a local trust policy or explicit configuration that authorizes the connection;
    * user confirmation, or the resource's origin appearing on an allowlist.

    This requirement applies regardless of `status`. A silent connection (`status` of `available`) needs it more than an interactive one, not less: because it completes with no user involvement, a malicious but internally consistent entry (its `resource`, that resource's Protected Resource Metadata, and `authorization_server` all attacker-controlled) would otherwise pass re-anchoring and cause the client to disclose its credential and user data to the attacker with no human in the loop. An audience-only connection (no `resource`; the `token_exchange` and `id_jag` types) is anchored as described in the preceding bullet instead.

* If a connection value conflicts with the authoritative metadata, the authoritative metadata takes precedence.

* When the resource's Protected Resource Metadata {{RFC9728}} indicates DPoP-bound access tokens are required (`dpop_bound_access_tokens_required`), or the client otherwise selected a DPoP-bound token for the connection, the client MUST present the token using DPoP {{RFC9449}} rather than as a plain bearer token. DPoP requirements and support are discovered from resource and authorization server metadata rather than restated in the catalog.

* To detect change cheaply, a client SHOULD use conditional requests against the catalog (see {{catalog-response}}). The catalog's `updated` time and entity tag indicate whether re-fetching is necessary.

Presentation for the `oauth` profile is resolved in this order: (1) an explicit `present`; (2) the named `security_scheme` resolved against the service's referenced descriptor; (3) an HTTP bearer token {{RFC6750}}; (4) otherwise, the security schemes published in the service's referenced descriptor.

The catalog's irreducible contribution is the user-scoped enumeration of which services and connection methods exist, and their per-user `status`, not the OAuth endpoints themselves, which remain owned by the authoritative metadata.

#### token_exchange {#type-token-exchange}

The client obtains a token by performing an OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange {{RFC8693}} at the `authorization_server`. As the `subject_token` the client presents a token it already holds whose subject is the user, typically the access token it used to retrieve the catalog, or another user token the `authorization_server` is configured to accept for exchange. Whether this connection is truly silent (`status` of `available`) depends on the client possessing such an acceptable subject token. If it does not, the exchange will fail and the client must obtain a suitable token first. This is the catalog equivalent of {{TOKEN-EXCHANGE-DISCOVERY}}.

Type-specific members:

audience:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving the `audience` value {{Section 2.1 of RFC8693}} to include in the token exchange request. The `audience` is the logical name of the target service and need not be a URI. It MAY be an opaque, authorization-server-local identifier. For a multi-tenant service, each tenant is a distinct service object (grouped by `group`; see {{service-object}}) whose connection carries a distinct `audience` value selecting that tenant. The tenant's descriptive identity is the service object's `tenant` member. Unlike `token_endpoint`, the `audience` selector has no independent metadata to validate against. It is a catalog-supplied value the client trusts to the extent it trusts the Catalog Provider, bounded by the trusted `authorization_server` ({{profile-oauth}}), which issues and audience-restricts the resulting token. A client SHOULD confirm that the token it receives is bound to the intended service before using it.

supported_token_types:
: OPTIONAL. An array of token type URIs {{RFC8693}} that may be requested. If omitted, the client may request any token type the authorization server supports.

#### authorization_code {#type-authorization-code}

The client obtains a token using the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant {{Section 4.1 of RFC6749}} with PKCE. This type typically has `status` of `consent_required`. The client uses the `authorization_server` metadata {{RFC8414}} to locate endpoints, includes the `resource` parameter {{RFC8707}}, and determines its client identity from `client_registration` (and, for `static`, `client_id`). This type defines no additional members.

For interactive acquisition, the client SHOULD pass the account's `login_hint`, or otherwise rely on the authorization server's account selection, to obtain a token for that account.

#### client_credentials {#type-client-credentials}

The client obtains a token using the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant {{Section 4.4 of RFC6749}}, authenticating as itself. The resulting token carries no user identity. This type is appropriate only when the agent acts as itself and the service does not need the user's identity, and the catalog includes it because such a service may still be relevant to the user's task. Because the per-user `status` vocabulary does not apply cleanly, a `client_credentials` connection SHOULD use `status` `available` (reflecting the client's own access, not the user's). The values `connected` and `consent_required` do not apply. Because this connection has no user relationship, the resource-confirmation requirement ({{profile-oauth}}) is satisfied by the client's local policy or configuration rather than by user confirmation. This type defines no additional members.

#### id_jag {#type-id-jag}

The client obtains an access token by redeeming an Identity Assertion Authorization Grant (ID-JAG) {{I-D.oauth-identity-assertion-authz-grant}} at the service's `authorization_server`. The client first obtains an ID-JAG for the user from the user's identity provider and then redeems it.

Type-specific members:

audience:
: OPTIONAL. A string giving the audience value identifying the service for which the ID-JAG is requested. For a multi-tenant service, the tenant is represented as in {{type-token-exchange}}: a distinct, grouped service object carrying the descriptive `tenant`, with the audience selecting it.

For silent acquisition (`token_exchange`, `id_jag`), the account is determined by the identity of the subject token (or assertion) the client presents. Selecting a `connected` account therefore means using the subject token that corresponds to it. The opaque `account.id` is a correlation handle, not a token request parameter. The catalog does not, by itself, map an `account` to a particular subject token: for silent multi-account acquisition the client MUST determine that mapping out of band (for example, from the subjects of the subject tokens it already holds). A catalog that lists multiple `connected` accounts on a silent OAuth connection type is thus actionable only by a client that already holds the corresponding subject tokens.

### Pre-Authorized Credential Profile {#profile-pre-authorized}

The `pre_authorized` profile describes a credential the client already possesses, or can obtain through a deployment-specific secure channel (for example, a secrets manager, an enterprise configuration system, or prior provisioning), never through the catalog. The catalog only signals that this method applies and, via the connection's `present` member ({{connection-object}}), how the credential is presented. It MUST NOT include the credential itself or any pointer that would let an unauthorized party retrieve it. This profile typically has `status` of `connected`.

Before presenting a pre-provisioned credential to a service's `endpoint`, the client MUST establish the binding between that `endpoint`, the credential, and the intended service from a trusted source (explicit configuration, a trust policy, or user confirmation), not from the catalog alone. Any sender-constraint requirement for such a connection is likewise conveyed out of band, since there is no OAuth protected resource metadata to discover it from.

### Proxy-Injected Credential Profile {#profile-proxy-injected}

The `proxy_injected` profile describes a connection in which the client never obtains or holds the service credential. A trusted intermediary (an egress proxy or gateway) attaches the credential to the client's requests to the service on the client's behalf. This narrows the client's exposure: a compromised client does not yield the long-lived service credential itself. It does not eliminate exposure. Where the client authenticates to an explicit proxy `uri` (below), that credential fronts every credential the intermediary will inject and is therefore itself sensitive. The policy by which the intermediary decides which credential to attach to which request is an out-of-band trust assumption the client depends on (a client that can steer its own destination could otherwise induce injection toward an unintended target). It is compatible with the audience-binding and no-passthrough rules of {{audience-binding}}, which the intermediary (acting as the client to the service) observes.

Profile-specific members:

proxy:
: OPTIONAL. A JSON object describing the intermediary. It MAY contain `uri` (a URI through which the client routes its requests to the service). When `uri` is absent, the intermediary operates transparently on the client's egress and is configured out of band.

When the client routes through an explicit proxy `uri`, the connection's `present` member ({{connection-object}}) describes how the client authenticates to the *intermediary* (for example, with its own bearer token or a sentinel), not to the service. The service-facing credential is held and presented solely by the intermediary, and the catalog MUST NOT convey it. Because a `proxy_injected` connection has no `authorization_server`, it cannot be re-anchored using the OAuth profile's resource metadata checks. The client MUST establish trust in the intermediary's `uri` and identity from a trusted source before routing requests through it.

### Single Sign-On Profile {#profile-sso}

The `sso` profile describes a launch-style connection: a browser single sign-on into a web application, in which the identity provider federates a session in a user agent and the client holds no credential. It models the entries of an enterprise single sign-on application catalog. An `sso` connection object MUST include a `type` member whose value is drawn from the "SSO Service Catalog Connection Type" registry ({{sso-connection-type-registry}}). This document defines `saml`, `oidc`, and `ws_fed`.

Profile-specific members:

launch_uri:
: REQUIRED. A URI that a user agent opens to begin single sign-on. For `saml`, it is the service-provider-initiated or identity-provider-initiated SSO start URL. For `oidc`, it is the relying party's third-party-initiated login initiation URI {{OPENID-CONNECT}}, which lets an application launcher start login at the relying party. The application's federation metadata (for example, SAML metadata or the OpenID Provider configuration) is referenced through a `describedby` link ({{link-object}}) rather than restated.

relay_state:
: OPTIONAL. A value the launcher passes to deep-link into a location within the application after sign-on. For `saml`, it is the SAML RelayState. For `oidc`, it is the `target_link_uri` of third-party-initiated login.

An `sso` connection is completed by opening `launch_uri` in a user agent, not by the client obtaining a token. The `present` member ({{connection-object}}) does not apply. Because access is browser-mediated, an `sso` connection is launchable on the user's behalf but is not programmatically callable by the client.

For a launch-style connection, access is always browser-mediated, so the `status` vocabulary describes assignment and sign-on readiness rather than credential acquisition:

* `connected`: the application is assigned to, or provisioned for, the user and is ready to launch.
* `consent_required`: launch will require interactive sign-on or consent the user has not yet completed.
* `available`: the application can be launched, but the provider does not distinguish a prior relationship.
* `unavailable`: the application is known but cannot currently be launched.

Here `available` and `consent_required` differ in whether interactive sign-on is expected, not in whether a browser is involved, since every launch uses the user's user agent.

Before launch, the client MUST establish the identity of the application and of the `launch_uri` from a trusted source ({{autonomous-trust}}), since an arbitrary catalog does not prove them. That trusted source MAY be the Catalog Provider itself when the client has established trust in that provider, for example the user's enterprise identity provider reached through verified discovery or explicit configuration. In that common deployment, trust in the provider and its enterprise policy satisfy this requirement, and no second source is needed. The requirement guards against trusting a `launch_uri` from a provider the client has not established trust in. Federation metadata and its format are defined by the relevant single sign-on specification. This document references such metadata by URL and does not restate it.

### Portal Profile {#profile-portal}

The `portal` profile describes a launch-only application: a link the user opens, where the application handles authentication by its own means, such as a bookmarked web application or one behind a password manager. It is the catalog equivalent of a single sign-on bookmark tile. Its only member is `launch_uri`, a URI the user agent opens. Like `sso`, a `portal` connection is browser-mediated and launchable on the user's behalf, the `present` member does not apply, the launch-style `status` semantics above apply, and the client MUST establish the identity of the `launch_uri` from a trusted source before launch ({{autonomous-trust}}).

### Public Service Profile {#profile-none}

The `none` profile describes a service that requires no client authentication. This profile defines no additional members and typically has `status` of `available`. Although no credential is presented, the client still sends requests, and possibly user data, to the service's `endpoint`. As with the other non-`oauth` profiles, the client MUST establish the service's identity from a trusted source (explicit configuration, a trust policy, or user confirmation), not from the catalog alone, before sending any user data.

A Catalog Provider MUST NOT include secret values (access tokens, refresh tokens, client secrets, API keys, or private keys) anywhere in the catalog.

## Examples {#response-example}

### A Minimal Catalog

The simplest useful catalog is one HTTP service with one OAuth connection. The client retrieves it, re-anchors the `authorization_server` against the `resource`, obtains a token, and calls the API.

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/service-catalog+json

    {
      "services": [
        {
          "id": "mail",
          "display_name": "Example Mail",
          "endpoint": "https://api.example.com/mail",
          "connections": [
            {
              "profile": "oauth",
              "type": "authorization_code",
              "status": "consent_required",
              "authorization_server": "https://as.example.com",
              "resource": "https://api.example.com/mail",
              "scopes": ["mail.read"]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }

The remaining examples show broader applicability: MCP and A2A services, multiple accounts, and a pre-provisioned credential.

### A Catalog Response

The following is a non-normative example response showing five services: an HTTP service in the `email` category offering both token exchange and user consent, an MCP server referencing its Server Card, a service the user is already connected to via a pre-provisioned API key (note the `present` member), an A2A agent referencing its Agent Card, and an SSO web application launched via OpenID Connect (note the `launch_uri` and the absence of a credential).

### Multiple Instances and Accounts {#instances-accounts}

A logical service the user can reach as more than one instance or tenant is returned as multiple service objects sharing a `group`. The user's multiple accounts at a service are returned as multiple connection objects distinguished by `account`. The following non-normative fragment shows the `services` array of such a catalog: two tenants of one logical service, and a service the user is connected to under two accounts (with a third connection to add another).

    "services": [
      {

      }
    ]

# Connecting to a Service {#connecting}

After retrieving the catalog, a client connects to a service by selecting a service object and one of its connection objects, and then executing the corresponding connection profile. For planning, the connection's `status` is the primary signal: whether a credential already exists (`connected`), can be obtained without user interaction (`available`), or requires consent (`consent_required`). The acquisition `profile` and any profile-specific `type` are the mechanism details the client uses once a connection is chosen. The general procedure is:

1. Select a service (for example, by `category`, `tags`, or by presenting `display_name` and `description` to the user). For an `mcp` service, the client MAY first fetch the MCP Server Card ({{type-mcp}}) to evaluate the server's capabilities.
2. Select a connection object. A client SHOULD prefer a connection whose `status` is `connected` or `available` over one whose `status` is `consent_required`, when more than one is suitable.
3. Apply the connection's trust gate before contacting the authorization server. For the `oauth` profile, apply its trust gate ({{profile-oauth}}): re-anchor by confirming, via the resource's Protected Resource Metadata {{RFC9728}}, that the connection's `authorization_server` is authoritative for the `resource`; or, for an audience-only `token_exchange` or `id_jag` connection that has no `resource`, apply the audience-only alternative instead. For other profiles, apply that profile's trust requirements ({{connection-profiles}}).
4. For the `oauth` profile, determine the client identity from `client_registration`. Do this only after the trust gate in the previous step, so that client metadata or a client-id URL is not disclosed to an unverified authorization server.
    * `static`: use the `client_id` member.
    * `dynamic`: register with the authorization server using {{RFC7591}}, subject to the trust policy of {{confused-deputy}}.
    * `client_id_metadata_document`: present an HTTPS URL the client controls as its `client_id`, per {{CIMD}}. The authorization server dereferences it, with no registration call.

    When `client_registration` is absent, use the `client_id` if present, and otherwise an identity the client determines is appropriate, or none where the flow requires none.
5. Obtain the credential according to the connection `profile` and profile-specific `type` (see {{connection-profiles}}), using the values on the selected connection object, including the `resource` {{RFC8707}} and `scopes` for OAuth connection types.
6. Call the service, presenting the credential as described by the connection's `present` member or, when it is absent, by the service's referenced security schemes (an OpenAPI {{OPENAPI}} document, an A2A Agent Card, or an MCP Server Card), for example, as a bearer token {{RFC6750}}, an API key, or a client certificate.

For a launch-style connection (`sso` or `portal`; see {{profile-sso}}), steps 4 through 6 do not apply. After the step 3 trust gate, the client, or the user agent it drives, opens the connection's `launch_uri` to begin sign-on, and holds no credential.

This specification does not define any new credential issuance mechanism. Each connection profile parameterizes an existing mechanism or deployment model.

# Intent-Based Use and Resource Discovery {#intent}

A client typically uses the catalog to plan: it discovers the services a user can reach, decides which it needs for the user's goal, and requests only the access that goal requires. The catalog's role here is bounded. It provides the candidate services (filterable by `category` and `tags`) and, per connection, an upper bound on the available access ({{connection-object}}). It does not compute the minimal access a given task needs: mapping an intent to the least-privilege request is the client's job, using the service's descriptor and, for Rich Authorization Requests, the type metadata referenced below. The catalog supports planning before commitment in two ways.

First, a client can plan from descriptors without connecting:

* A service object's `links` reference the service's capability descriptor, for example, an OpenAPI {{OPENAPI}} document via a `service-desc` link, or an MCP Server Card {{MCP-SERVER-CARD}} via an `mcp-server-card` link. A client MAY read these to understand a service's operations and resources, and plan, without obtaining any token.

* The connection's `scopes` and `authorization_details_types` are only an upper bound ({{connection-object}}). The authoritative, fine-grained requirements come from the service, and their granularity differs by service type:

    * an `http` service described by OpenAPI exposes operations with per-operation `security` and required scopes;
    * an `mcp` service exposes tools enumerated at runtime, where scopes are typically server-wide (via the server's Protected Resource Metadata {{RFC9728}}) rather than per-tool;
    * an `a2a` service exposes skills described in its Agent Card.

    A client maps its intended operations, tools, or skills to the minimal scopes and authorization details it must request. Two consequences follow:

    * Because an `mcp` service's scopes are typically server-wide, it can usually be scoped only at server granularity. A task that needs less than the whole server's access cannot, in general, be expressed for `mcp` through scopes.
    * Turning an advertised `authorization_details` type into a minimal request requires that type's schema, which the authorization server provides only if it publishes Authorization Details Types Metadata {{RAR-METADATA}}. Absent that, the client knows only the type identifier and typically falls back to `scopes`.

* For a multi-step goal spanning operations or services, a client MAY use a workflow description such as Arazzo {{ARAZZO}} to plan the sequence before acquiring any token.

Second, a client can connect with minimal access to enumerate, then request what is needed. When an agent must inspect the user's actual resources before planning (for example, to list the user's mailboxes or calendars), it SHOULD select a connection and request the least-privilege access sufficient to enumerate, such as narrow `scopes`, or a minimal `authorization_details` request limited to the `authorization_details_types` the connection advertises ({{connection-object}}), and then make a further, intent-scoped request for the access it determines it needs. Whether such narrowing is honored, and whether the later request can add access without repeating prior consent, depend on the authorization server and are not advertised in the catalog. The client therefore cannot assume least-privilege narrowing or silent escalation, and SHOULD be prepared for either a single sufficient request or a fresh consent.

Incremental, intent-scoped requests keep each token least-privilege. To support them:

* When a connection advertises `authorization_details_types` and the authorization server offers a pushed authorization request endpoint {{RFC9126}}, the client SHOULD push the (potentially large) `authorization_details` request rather than place it in a front-channel URL.

* A client MUST be prepared for runtime escalation signals it cannot fully predict from the catalog: a resource server MAY indicate that stronger or fresher user authentication is required {{RFC9470}}, or that the presented authorization details are insufficient {{RAR-METADATA}}. In each case the client repeats the request with the indicated requirements.

The catalog is an authorization-filtered overlay: it lists what a user can reach and how to connect, but it does not republish a service's full capability surface. A client obtains the authoritative, and possibly authorization-dependent, capability list from the service itself (for example, an MCP server's runtime tool list) or from a referenced descriptor, not from the catalog.

# Relationship to Other Work {#related-work}

The Service Catalog occupies a layer that existing mechanisms do not: a per-user, authorization-filtered overlay that enumerates a user's reachable services and how to connect to each. It composes with, rather than replaces, the following.

Enterprise identity providers already expose per-user application catalogs: the assigned-application APIs behind single sign-on app launchers, such as Okta's assigned-applications API {{OKTA-APPS}} and Microsoft Graph's app role assignments {{MSGRAPH-APPROLES}}, which drive the MyApps portal and comparable dashboards. These are the closest existing analogue to this document, a per-user, authorization-aware list of reachable services. They are, however, provider-specific, oriented to interactive single sign-on, and silent on how to connect programmatically. This document standardizes that per-user view across identity providers and enriches it with machine-readable connection methods spanning credential acquisition and launch-style single sign-on, and with service types beyond web applications (HTTP APIs, MCP servers, and A2A agents). The `sso` and `portal` profiles ({{profile-sso}}, {{profile-portal}}) cover the interactive launch case those APIs already serve.

OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange Target Service Discovery {{TOKEN-EXCHANGE-DISCOVERY}} discovers the audiences, resources, and scopes a subject token may be exchanged for. It is specialized to token exchange. The `oauth` profile's `token_exchange` connection type ({{type-token-exchange}}) carries the same information as one connection method among several. The two are independent and this document does not depend on it.

Rich Authorization Requests {{RFC9396}} and its metadata extension {{RAR-METADATA}} express and describe fine-grained authorization details, but their metadata is server-wide. The catalog advertises, per service and per user, which `authorization_details` types are usable ({{connection-object}}) and defers each type's schema and documentation to {{RAR-METADATA}}.

Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP) {{RFC9635}} negotiates the access a client declares it wants at a single grant endpoint. Its intent is client-declared, not a server-advertised enumeration of what a user can reach. A catalog entry's `id` and connection values name what a client can subsequently request, whether by token exchange, an OAuth grant, or a GNAP access request.

OpenID Federation {{OPENID-FEDERATION}} establishes trust among many entities through verifiable trust chains and trust marks, and can automate client registration. It is one way to discharge the trust decisions this document requires when a client connects to authorization servers it did not know in advance ({{trust-frameworks}}). The catalog enumerates what is reachable, while the federation supplies the basis for trusting it.

User-Managed Access (UMA 2.0) {{UMA2}} lets a resource owner share resources with other parties. Its resource registration is resource-server-to-authorization-server and is not client-facing, and its resource list is a synchronization aid rather than a browsable, per-user catalog. The catalog fills that client-facing gap.

Agent and tool descriptors (A2A Agent Cards {{A2A}}, MCP Server Cards {{MCP-SERVER-CARD}}, and machine-readable API descriptions such as OpenAPI {{OPENAPI}}) describe a single service instance, including its capabilities and how it authenticates callers. The catalog references these (via `links`) rather than duplicating them, and adds the per-user authorization context they lack.

Per-ecosystem registries, such as the Model Context Protocol registry {{MCP-REGISTRY}}, enumerate the servers or agents that exist within one protocol, for public discovery rather than per-user authorization. This document is the cross-protocol, per-user layer above them. For an authenticated user it enumerates which services are reachable, across HTTP APIs, MCP servers, A2A agents, and single sign-on applications, and how to connect to each, referencing each ecosystem's own descriptor or registry rather than restating it. Even if a per-ecosystem registry gains a per-user facet, that facet stays within its protocol. The contribution here is the identity-provider-anchored aggregation across protocols and administrative domains: the per-user entry point a client consults first, from which it follows references into the per-protocol descriptors.

APIs.json {{APISJSON}} provides a public "sitemap for APIs" with no per-user authorization context. A service object reuses its discoverability model: `display_name`, `description`, `endpoint` (its `baseURL`), `tags`, and `links` (its typed `properties`). A Catalog Provider MAY additionally serve a static APIs.json document for tooling that consumes that format. Such a document is out of scope for this specification.

Agentic Resource Discovery {{ARD}} defines a public, cross-organization discovery layer for agentic resources: an organization publishes a static catalog at a well-known location on its domain, registries crawl and index it, and an agent finds capabilities by intent and verifies the publisher's cryptographic identity before connecting. It operates at a different, complementary layer. It is public, crawlable, and pre-invocation, anchoring trust in a signed publisher identity and delegating authentication to each artifact's native protocol. The catalog defined here is per-user, authenticated, and (for the reasons in {{privacy-considerations}}) deliberately not crawlable. It anchors trust in the user's identity provider and in re-anchoring each connection to the resource's metadata ({{profile-oauth}}). It contributes the layer the former leaves open: which services a specific user and client can reach, and how each connection is established. A service object's optional `uid` ({{service-object}}) lets a client correlate one service across the two.

The AI Catalog format {{AI-CATALOG}} is a public, artifact-agnostic catalog of AI artifacts, such as MCP servers, A2A agents, agent skills, and plugins. It is served at a well-known location, identifies each entry by media type, and carries an optional signed publisher trust manifest. It is a public inventory, without per-user authorization, connection methods, or per-connection status. This document composes with it as it does with Agentic Resource Discovery. An AI Catalog enumerates what artifacts exist publicly. This catalog adds the per-user, authorization-filtered view of which of them a given user can reach and how to connect. A Catalog Provider MAY additionally serve a public AI Catalog as the unauthenticated inventory of the services it fronts, and MAY derive a per-user catalog from an AI Catalog by adding authorization filtering and connection methods. It MUST NOT place per-user connection state in a public AI Catalog ({{information-disclosure}}). A service object's `uid` ({{service-object}}) MAY equal an AI Catalog entry's identifier so a client can correlate the two, and this document's media type ({{iana-media-type}}) MAY be used as an AI Catalog entry type, so that an entry can point to a per-user Service Catalog Endpoint.

Several of the above are evolving specifications: A2A {{A2A}}, MCP Server Cards {{MCP-SERVER-CARD}}, and {{RAR-METADATA}} are referenced here as directional rather than stable dependencies. The catalog's core function (per-user enumeration of services and their connection methods) does not depend on any of them. A Catalog Provider and client can interoperate using only OAuth 2.0 metadata ({{RFC9728}}, {{RFC8414}}) and human-readable links, and treat references to those evolving formats as optional enhancements.

# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

The detailed requirements that follow rest on a few invariants. A reader who holds these in mind will find the rest of this section straightforward:

* The catalog is not authoritative for a service's identity.
* The catalog is not authoritative for OAuth endpoints.
* A `status` of `connected` is not proof of access or trust.
* Credentials never come from the catalog.
* Each connection profile defines the trust gate a client applies before use.

## Authentication and Transport

The Service Catalog Endpoint MUST be served over TLS {{Section 1.6 of RFC6749}}. The Catalog Provider MUST authenticate the request and produce the catalog only for the authenticated user. Credentials MUST NOT be placed in the request URI.

## Information Disclosure {#information-disclosure}

The catalog reveals the complete set of services a user can reach, together with the authentication schemes and connection methods for each. This is strictly more information than a per-service discovery: a single compromised user or client token yields the user's entire reachable map in one call, making the catalog a reconnaissance oracle. To mitigate this risk:

* The Catalog Provider MUST require authentication and return only services and connection methods the authenticated user and client are authorized to use. This authorization filtering applies to every request, whatever its scope.
* A scoped request, by capability or search term, is the expected shape, and the Catalog Provider SHOULD return only the services responsive to it. A full enumeration of a user's reachable set is the highest-value reconnaissance result, so the Catalog Provider SHOULD treat unscoped, full-catalog enumeration as a privileged operation. It MAY require a scoping parameter, and MAY restrict full enumeration to clients specifically authorized for it ({{catalog-request}}).
* The Catalog Provider SHOULD apply rate limiting (signaled with HTTP 429 and `Retry-After`; see {{error-response}}), SHOULD monitor for enumeration-style access patterns, and SHOULD log access for security monitoring.
* Responses are user specific and MUST NOT be cached by shared caches. Cache directives, when present, MUST mark the response as private.

## No Secrets in the Catalog

A Catalog Provider MUST NOT include secret values (access tokens, refresh tokens, client secrets, API keys, or private keys) in the catalog. Connection objects describe how to obtain or present a credential, not the credential itself. Consistent with {{MCP-SERVER-CARD}}, a referenced MCP Server Card likewise MUST NOT contain secrets. A client treats the card as untrusted input and validates it.

## Token Audience Binding and Passthrough {#audience-binding}

For `oauth` profile connection methods, the following requirements bind tokens to their intended service and mirror the token audience and passthrough guidance in {{MCP-AUTHORIZATION}}:

* A client MUST request tokens scoped to the specific service it intends to call, including the `resource` indicator {{RFC8707}}, so that issued tokens are bound to their intended service.
* A client MUST NOT present a token issued for one service to a different service.
* A service acting as a client to a further upstream service MUST obtain a separate token, rather than passing through the token it received.

## Trust in the Catalog Provider

A client trusts the Catalog Provider to enumerate services, endpoints, and connection methods accurately. Because the catalog aggregates connection information for potentially all of a user's services, a compromised or overly broad Catalog Provider is a high-value single point: it could direct the client to attacker-controlled services or authorization servers for many services at once. An autonomous client typically has no site-specific policy to judge an endpoint. The following therefore apply:

* For the `oauth` profile, the client MUST re-anchor trust to the resource being called before obtaining or presenting any credential, confirming via the resource's Protected Resource Metadata {{RFC9728}} that the connection's `authorization_server` is authoritative for that `resource` ({{profile-oauth}}).
* For other profiles, the client MUST apply that profile's binding and trust requirements.
* A client SHOULD obtain the Catalog Provider's base URL from a trusted source ({{endpoint-discovery}}), and SHOULD apply the same scrutiny to resources referenced by `links` (such as a `service-desc` or `mcp-server-card`).

## Trust Requirements for Autonomous Clients {#autonomous-trust}

Several connection methods are safe only when the client can establish trust from a source other than the catalog. These requirements are stated with each method; this section collects them so that an implementer of an autonomous client (one with no human in the loop and typically no site-specific policy) can see the floor at a glance:

* `pre_authorized` ({{profile-pre-authorized}}) and `none` ({{profile-none}}): the client establishes the binding between the service's `endpoint` and the intended service from a trusted source before sending any credential or user data.
* `proxy_injected` ({{profile-proxy-injected}}): the client establishes trust in the intermediary's `uri` and identity, and relies on the intermediary's credential-selection policy.
* Launch-style connections, `sso` and `portal` ({{profile-sso}}, {{profile-portal}}): the client establishes the identity of the application and of the `launch_uri` from a trusted source before opening it. That source MAY be a Catalog Provider the client trusts, such as the user's enterprise identity provider ({{profile-sso}}).
* Audience-only `token_exchange` and `id_jag` ({{profile-oauth}}): the client independently trusts the connection's `authorization_server` before presenting a `subject_token` or assertion.
* Dynamic client registration ({{confused-deputy}}): the client gates registration on a trust policy.
* Any connection whose relationship the client cannot independently corroborate ({{profile-oauth}}): the client independently confirms the resource, regardless of `status`. Catalog-asserted `connected` does not by itself corroborate a relationship.

For an `oauth` connection, the *minimum technical checks* an autonomous client always performs are: (1) the connection carries an explicit `resource`, and (2) it re-anchors successfully, confirming via that resource's Protected Resource Metadata {{RFC9728}} that the connection's `authorization_server` is authoritative for it ({{profile-oauth}}). These checks are necessary but not sufficient: they establish that the authorization server is authoritative for the resource, not that the resource is the service the user intended, which a compromised Catalog Provider can still misrepresent (including by asserting a `status` of `connected`). An autonomous client therefore MUST additionally have an independently established basis for the connection (a prior relationship it can corroborate from its own state, a local trust policy, or user confirmation; see {{profile-oauth}}), and MUST NOT rely on catalog-asserted `connected` alone. Absent such a basis, or for any connection method outside these checks, the client MUST NOT proceed without out-of-band trust.

## Confused Deputy and Client Registration {#confused-deputy}

When an `oauth` connection's `client_registration` is `dynamic` ({{RFC7591}}), the client registers with an authorization server it may not have known in advance, and registration happens before any token is obtained. This is the same gate referenced in the connection procedure ({{connecting}}, step 3), and is consistent with the confused-deputy guidance in {{MCP-AUTHORIZATION}}. The following apply:

* A client MUST gate dynamic registration on a trust policy, rather than registering automatically. The policy can be an allowlist of acceptable issuers, membership in a trust framework ({{trust-frameworks}}), an issuer-matching policy, or explicit user or administrator confirmation.
* An autonomous client, which typically has no site-specific policy, MUST NOT auto-register with a catalog-discovered authorization server absent such a policy or confirmation.
* Before registering, the client SHOULD re-anchor the connection's `authorization_server` to the resource's Protected Resource Metadata ({{profile-oauth}}), so that it does not disclose client metadata to an authorization server it has not verified.

The Client ID Metadata Document mechanism ({{CIMD}}) is a lighter-weight alternative to dynamic registration: it makes no registration write and yields no client secret. The client still presents its `client_id` URL to a catalog-discovered authorization server, which then dereferences it, so the same re-anchoring SHOULD precede its use.

## Trust Frameworks {#trust-frameworks}

Several requirements in this document reduce to one question: may the client trust an authorization server, or a resource, that it did not know in advance? They include re-anchoring an `oauth` connection ({{profile-oauth}}), gating dynamic client registration ({{confused-deputy}}), and trusting the `authorization_server` of an audience-only connection ({{profile-oauth}}).

A deployment MAY discharge that decision through a *trust framework*: a shared, verifiable basis for trusting parties a client did not know in advance. This document neither defines nor mandates one. A trust framework may be as simple as a static issuer allowlist or an enterprise trust policy, or a standardized framework such as OpenID Federation {{OPENID-FEDERATION}}, which provides verifiable trust chains and trust marks and can also automate client registration.

Where the client and the relevant authorization servers participate in such a framework, the client uses it to satisfy the trust gates above. For OpenID Federation in particular, a verified trust chain satisfies the dynamic-registration gate of {{confused-deputy}}, and the client MAY register through the framework rather than by plain {{RFC7591}}.

This adds no framework-specific members to the catalog. A client resolves framework membership and trust through the framework's own mechanisms, then re-anchors as in {{profile-oauth}}. The trust framework, where one exists, supplies the basis for trusting the servers a connection names. The catalog's role is unchanged.

## Authorization Server Mix-Up

A catalog directs a client to potentially many authorization servers, and an agent may run several authorization flows concurrently. These are the conditions under which authorization server mix-up attacks arise. A client using the `oauth` profile's `authorization_code` connection type SHOULD use the `iss` authorization response parameter {{RFC9207}} and verify that it identifies the expected authorization server, and MUST otherwise follow the mix-up mitigations of current OAuth security best practice. Re-anchoring each connection's `authorization_server` to the resource's Protected Resource Metadata ({{profile-oauth}}) further reduces this risk.

## Launch-Style Single Sign-On

A launch-style connection ({{profile-sso}}, {{profile-portal}}) directs a user agent to a catalog-supplied `launch_uri`, and carries the web single sign-on risks of that flow:

* The `launch_uri`, and any `relay_state` or `target_link_uri`, are catalog-supplied and untrusted. A client MUST confirm the `launch_uri` against a trusted source before opening it ({{autonomous-trust}}). It MUST NOT allow a catalog-supplied `relay_state` or `target_link_uri` to drive an open redirect or a deep link outside the intended application.
* A `launch_uri` may invoke identity-provider-initiated sign-on, which accepts an unsolicited assertion and lacks the request-to-response binding of a service-provider-initiated flow. A client SHOULD prefer service-provider-initiated sign-on where the application supports it.
* The flow completes in the user's own user agent and establishes a session for the user, not for the client. A client MUST NOT treat completion as a credential it holds or can replay.

Protocol-level mitigations are defined by the relevant single sign-on specification ({{OPENID-CONNECT}} and the SAML specifications). This document does not restate them.

# Privacy Considerations {#privacy-considerations}

The catalog is inherently personal: it describes the services a specific user can access. This may reveal organizational affiliations, tenant memberships, and the user's relationships to third-party services. To protect privacy:

* The catalog contents MUST be obtained through an authenticated channel ({{endpoint-discovery}}). The Service Catalog Endpoint URL is host-level and MAY appear in public metadata ({{catalog-metadata}}). A per-user-specific endpoint URL would itself be personal data and MUST NOT be published. In particular, WebFinger {{RFC7033}} MUST NOT be used to convey the catalog endpoint or its contents: WebFinger responses are unauthenticated and, by design, broadly accessible (including cross-origin), so publishing the set of services a user can reach there would disclose personal data to anyone. WebFinger is used only to resolve a user identifier to an issuer.
* The Catalog Provider SHOULD return only information the authenticated user and client are authorized to know, applying the principle of least privilege.
* The Catalog Provider SHOULD NOT include identifiers of other users or of tenants the user is not associated with.
* Account labels (`account.label`) MAY be personal data (for example, an email address). The Catalog Provider SHOULD return the minimum needed for the user to distinguish accounts (a display name or masked address) and MAY omit the label entirely, leaving only the opaque `account.id`.
* A service object's `uid` ({{service-object}}), being a stable identifier intended to correlate a service across providers, is a potential correlation handle. A Catalog Provider SHOULD include it only where cross-catalog correlation is intended, and a `uid` MUST NOT be derived from, or encode, personal data.
* A service object's `logo_uri` ({{service-object}}) is an external image reference. A client that fetches it (for example, in an application launcher) discloses to the image host that the user is viewing the service, and the image can act as a tracking beacon. A client SHOULD treat it as it would any third-party image, and a Catalog Provider SHOULD host logos on an origin it controls.
* The Catalog Provider SHOULD log access in accordance with applicable privacy regulations and SHOULD minimize retention of catalog requests.
* A deployment MAY provide mechanisms for users to review and limit the services exposed through the catalog.

IANA is requested to register the following well-known URI in the "Well-Known URIs" registry established by {{RFC8615}}.

URI Suffix: `service-catalog`

Change Controller: IETF

Specification Document(s): This document.

Status: permanent

Related Information: Identifies a catalog metadata document ({{catalog-metadata}}), a JSON object whose `service_catalog_endpoint` member names the per-user Service Catalog Endpoint. The well-known URI does not itself return the per-user catalog.

## Service Catalog Service Type Registry {#iana-service-type}

IANA is requested to establish the "Service Catalog Service Type" registry for values of the `type` member of a service object ({{service-object}}). The registration policy is Specification Required. Each registration contains the type value, a brief description, any service-type-specific members it defines, and a reference. Values are case-sensitive strings of printable ASCII characters without whitespace. Initial contents:

| Service Type | Description | Members | Reference |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------- | --------- |
| `http` | HTTP API | None | {{type-http}} |
| `mcp` | Model Context Protocol server | `mcp` | {{type-mcp}} |
| `a2a` | Agent2Agent agent | `a2a` | {{type-a2a}} |

## Service Catalog Service Category Registry {#iana-category}

IANA is requested to establish the "Service Catalog Service Category" registry for values of the `categories` member of a service object and the `category` query parameter ({{service-categories}}). The registration policy is Expert Review, a lighter bar than the Specification Required used for the protocol-affecting registries, since a category is a descriptive capability label rather than something that changes client behavior. The designated expert should confirm that a proposed category is broadly applicable, is not a near-duplicate of an existing value, and has a clear description, so that the vocabulary agents plan against stays coherent. Each registration contains the category value, a brief description, and a reference or contact. Values are case-sensitive strings of printable ASCII characters without whitespace. An implementation-specific or experimental category that is not registered MUST use a collision-resistant, namespaced form (for example, a reverse-DNS prefix such as `com.example.crm`) so it cannot clash with a registered value. Initial contents:

| Category | Description | Reference |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- |
| `email` | Electronic mail | {{service-categories}} |
| `calendar` | Calendaring and scheduling | {{service-categories}} |
| `contacts` | Contact and address book | {{service-categories}} |
| `files` | File storage | {{service-categories}} |
| `chat` | Messaging and chat | {{service-categories}} |
| `tasks` | Tasks and to-do | {{service-categories}} |
| `crm` | Customer relationship management | {{service-categories}} |
| `ticketing` | Support ticketing and issue tracking | {{service-categories}} |

## Service Catalog Connection Profile Registry {#connection-profile-registry}

IANA is requested to establish the "Service Catalog Connection Profile" registry for values of the `profile` member of a connection object ({{connection-object}}). The registration policy is Specification Required. Each registration contains the profile value, a brief description, the profile-specific members it defines (if any), whether it defines a profile-specific `type` registry, and a reference. Values are case-sensitive strings of printable ASCII characters without whitespace. Initial contents:

| Profile | Description | Members | Type Registry | Reference |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------- | --------- |
| `oauth` | OAuth 2.0 token acquisition | `authorization_server`, `token_endpoint`, `resource`, `scopes`, `authorization_details_types`, `client_id`, `client_registration` | {{oauth-connection-type-registry}} | {{profile-oauth}} |
| `pre_authorized` | Pre-provisioned out-of-band credential | None | None | {{profile-pre-authorized}} |
| `proxy_injected` | Credential injected by a trusted intermediary | `proxy` | None | {{profile-proxy-injected}} |
| `sso` | Browser single sign-on launch | `launch_uri`, `relay_state` | {{sso-connection-type-registry}} | {{profile-sso}} |
| `portal` | Launch-only application link | `launch_uri` | None | {{profile-portal}} |
| `none` | No credential required (public) | None | None | {{profile-none}} |

## OAuth Service Catalog Connection Type Registry {#oauth-connection-type-registry}

IANA is requested to establish the "OAuth Service Catalog Connection Type" registry for values of the `type` member of an `oauth` profile connection object ({{profile-oauth}}). The registration policy is Specification Required. Each registration contains the connection type value, a brief description, the type-specific members it defines (if any), and a reference. Values are case-sensitive strings of printable ASCII characters without whitespace. Initial contents:

| Connection Type | Description | Members | Reference |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------- | --------- |
| `token_exchange` | OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange | `audience`, `supported_token_types` | {{type-token-exchange}} |
| `authorization_code` | Authorization code grant with PKCE | None | {{type-authorization-code}} |

## SSO Service Catalog Connection Type Registry {#sso-connection-type-registry}

IANA is requested to establish the "SSO Service Catalog Connection Type" registry for values of the `type` member of an `sso` profile connection object ({{profile-sso}}). The registration policy is Specification Required. Each registration contains the connection type value, a brief description, and a reference. Values are case-sensitive strings of printable ASCII characters without whitespace. Initial contents:

| Connection Type | Description | Reference |
| --------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| `saml` | SAML 2.0 web browser single sign-on | {{profile-sso}} |
| `oidc` | OpenID Connect single sign-on, including third-party-initiated login | {{profile-sso}} |
| `ws_fed` | WS-Federation web single sign-on | {{profile-sso}} |

## Link Relation Types {#iana-link-relations}

IANA is requested to register the following relation types in the "Link Relation Types" registry established by {{RFC8288}}.

Relation Name: `sign-up`

Description: Refers to a resource where a user can sign up for the linked service.

Reference: This document.

Relation Name: `request-access`

Description: Refers to a resource where a user can request access to the linked service that they cannot currently use.

Reference: This document.

Relation Name: `mcp-server-card`

Description: Refers to the Model Context Protocol Server Card for the linked service.

Reference: This document.

* Corrected the connecting procedure: the `oauth` trust gate covers the audience-only alternative for resource-less `token_exchange`/`id_jag`, and `client_registration` (an `oauth`-only member) is scoped to `oauth` connections. Clarified that the launch-style trusted source MAY be a Catalog Provider the client trusts, such as the user's enterprise identity provider, so `sso`/`portal` do not require a second source.
* Closed catalog gaps surfaced in review: a `warnings` member reports incomplete or degraded aggregation, so a client does not mistake an unreachable source for lack of access; a freshness paragraph states the catalog is a polling-with-conditional-requests snapshot with no push mechanism; `preferred` and `deprecated` service members aid selection and lifecycle; and a `request-access` link relation gives a remediation path for services the user cannot currently use.
* Clarified that the discoverable Service Catalog Endpoint URL is host-level and MUST NOT encode per-user information (the catalog is scoped by the access token, not the URL), reconciling its publication in public metadata with the privacy requirement that per-user data stay on an authenticated channel.
* Added a Relationship to Other Work entry for the public AI Catalog format, composing with it the same way as with Agentic Resource Discovery: a `uid` MAY equal an AI Catalog entry identifier, a provider MAY serve or derive a public AI Catalog (without per-user connection state), and this document's media type MAY be used as an AI Catalog entry type pointing to a per-user Service Catalog Endpoint. No new wire members.
* Sharpened the positioning against per-ecosystem registries (for example, the Model Context Protocol registry): the catalog is the cross-protocol, per-user, identity-provider-anchored layer above them, referencing each ecosystem's descriptor or registry rather than competing with it, so a per-ecosystem per-user facet would stay within its protocol while this remains the cross-protocol aggregation.
* Added a Relationship to Other Work entry for the incumbent per-user application catalogs (Okta's assigned-applications API and Microsoft Graph app role assignments), positioning the document as standardizing that per-user view across identity providers and enriching it with programmatic connection methods and service types beyond web applications.
* Added a Trust Frameworks security section that lets a deployment discharge the document's trust decisions (re-anchoring, the dynamic-registration gate, audience-only authorization-server trust) through a pluggable trust framework, with OpenID Federation as a worked example and a Relationship to Other Work entry. This adds no catalog members or registries; a client resolves framework trust through the framework's own mechanisms.
* Redefined the `/.well-known/service-catalog` URI as a cacheable, host-level catalog metadata document whose `service_catalog_endpoint` member names the per-user Service Catalog Endpoint, rather than serving the per-user catalog at the well-known path itself. This matches the cacheable-metadata convention of other well-known URIs and keeps the authenticated, per-user catalog at a separate endpoint. The authorization server metadata value remains the primary discovery mechanism.
* Titled the document "Per-User Service Connectivity Catalog", naming the artifact the document is built around (the catalog, matching the registered `service-catalog` media type, well-known URI, and metadata), with "service connectivity discovery" retained as the protocol that produces it. Repositioned around per-user, authorization-aware connectivity.
* Rewrote the abstract into three short paragraphs reflecting the matured scope: broadened consumers beyond agents, credential-based and launch-style (single sign-on) connection methods, and the enterprise SSO application catalog superset. Opened the introduction client-first with the autonomous agent as the leading example.
* Trimmed the introduction: removed the "deliberately general" bullet list, which sat before the Minimal Core and overlapped it and the guiding principle, and folded the distinctive capabilities (capability-based discovery, first-class MCP/A2A, intent-scoped planning) into a short paragraph after the Minimal Core.
* Generalized the base `type` and `status` member definitions so they cover launch-style connections, not only credential acquisition, and added a privacy note for `logo_uri` as an external image reference.
* Renamed the service object's `base_uri` member to `endpoint`, a type-neutral name that reads correctly for `http`, `mcp`, and `a2a` services, consistent with the type-neutral core.
* Split service identity into a human-readable `display_name` and an optional machine-readable `name` (a slug, distinct from the opaque `id`), added a `logo_uri` member, and renamed the human-readable catalog and group fields to `display_name` and `group_display_name`. The OpenAPI `apiKey` `name` inside `present` is unaffected.
* Propagated launch-style access through the credential-centric text: the connecting procedure now skips the credential steps for `sso`/`portal` and opens `launch_uri`, the `connections` member describes connecting rather than obtaining credentials, and the autonomous-client trust list includes launch-style connections. Renamed the `proxy` object's `endpoint` member to `uri` to avoid overloading the service `endpoint` name.
* Hardened launch-style single sign-on after expert review: added a Security Considerations subsection on launch-style risks (untrusted `launch_uri`/`relay_state`, identity-provider-initiated sign-on, completion in the user's user agent), defined the `status` vocabulary for launch-style connections, and finished generalizing the overview and connection-object framing to cover launch-style alongside credential acquisition.
* Added launch-style connection profiles so the catalog is a superset of an enterprise single sign-on application catalog. The `sso` profile (with an "SSO Service Catalog Connection Type" registry seeded with `saml`, `oidc`, and `ws_fed`) carries a `launch_uri`, where `oidc` is first class via third-party-initiated login. The `portal` profile covers launch-only bookmark applications. Generalized the connection-method definition to cover launch-style access, in which the identity provider federates a browser session and the client holds no credential.
* Grounded the Catalog Provider in the existing enterprise single sign-on application catalog, with an identity provider as a natural provider, and stated the small-core and separately-evolvable-profiles principle as a front-door design statement. Made the autonomy value proposition precise. An agent autonomously discovers, plans, and reconnects to already-linked services, while automated connection to an unfamiliar service requires prior trust, local policy, or user confirmation.
* Restructured connection methods into a core connection object plus connection profiles (`oauth`, `pre_authorized`, `proxy_injected`, `none`), with profile-specific acquisition `type`s for `oauth` (`token_exchange`, `authorization_code`, `client_credentials`, `id_jag`) in their own registry.
* Made `client_registration` an explicit mode enumeration and added the `client_id_metadata_document` (CIMD) mode {{CIMD}}, in which the client uses an HTTPS URL it controls as its `client_id`.
* Specified the presentation layer: `present` is an OpenAPI 3.1+ Security Scheme Object with casing preserved, `apiKey` schemes are recommended to use `in: header`, and the catalog references a service's descriptor rather than restating its security schemes.
* Established the trust model. A client re-anchors each `oauth` connection to the resource's Protected Resource Metadata before using it. A catalog-asserted relationship (`status` of `connected`) is a hint, not proof, and does not waive independent resource confirmation, which the client meets from its own corroborated state, local policy, or user confirmation. Audience-only `token_exchange`/`id_jag` connections additionally bind the (`authorization_server`, `audience`) pair through local policy. A "Trust Requirements for Autonomous Clients" section states the minimum technical checks as necessary but not sufficient.
* Framed inclusion as two levels: discoverability authorization (what the catalog asserts) versus runtime authorization (the service and its authorization server's decision at call time).
* Added a mandatory-to-implement bearer authentication baseline and made the dynamic-registration trust gate a MUST for autonomous clients.
* Gave `pre_authorized`, `proxy_injected`, and `none` out-of-band service-identity and trust requirements, and noted the intermediary-credential and injection-selection trust dependencies of `proxy_injected`.
* Added an optional `uid` cross-catalog service identifier with an issuer-controlled minting model and privacy guidance.
* Specified filtering (whole-object selection, effective status), pagination (next-page precedence, `limit` bounds, best-effort snapshot), `Accept` content negotiation, and the error model (429 with `Retry-After`, distinct problem `type`s); and fixed the omit-empty rule so `services` is always present, empty when none.
* Made a scoped, capability-first request the expected shape and full-catalog enumeration a privileged operation. A provider returns a minimal slice for a stated need and may restrict full enumeration, which limits the reconnaissance value of a single request.
* Restructured the front matter to lead with the core. Added a "Minimal Core" summary, a "Security Model at a Glance" invariant list, and the composition frame (glue, not a new center of gravity). Aligned the abstract and the definition with the scoped-request model so neither promises a full enumeration, and folded the RFC 8414 reachability analogue into the identity-provider grounding rather than stating it as a separate framing. Broadened the consumer framing beyond agents to include command-line tools, SDKs, application launchers, workflow tools, and delegated assistants. Reordered the connecting procedure so the trust gate precedes dynamic registration and Client ID Metadata Document use. Reframed connection `status` as an availability signal rather than a trust assertion. Added a minimal one-service OAuth example before the broader one.
* Reframed the intent section: the catalog provides candidate services and an access ceiling, not the intent-to-minimal-grant mapping (the client derives that from the service descriptor and Rich Authorization Requests type metadata), and `mcp` services are generally scopable only at server granularity.
* Added a Relationship to Other Work entry distinguishing Agentic Resource Discovery (public, pre-invocation, publisher-signed) from this per-user, authenticated connectivity layer.
* Moved DPoP {{RFC9449}} to normative references (it is cited with a conditional MUST), and set the Service Category registry to Expert Review while keeping Specification Required for the protocol-affecting registries.
